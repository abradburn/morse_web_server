# morse_web_server
The web server portion of my morseduino project.

This project was designed to be an educational experience for myself.

My original goals were:
  Learn how to program an Esp8266 chip.
  Establish the groundwork for an expandable sensor network.
  Establish a basic bi-directional communication platform.

This is the web server portion of this project.
